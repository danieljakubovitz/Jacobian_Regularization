# Jacobian_Regularization

Implementation of Jacobian Regularization as described in the paper "Jacobian Regularization for improved DNN robustness to adversarial attacks" (ECCV 2018 Conference Paper): https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08680.pdf

The MNIST implementation is based on the official TensorFlow tutorial.
